## Background
I was in a 6-month COOP fellowship Program where they help first-generation college graduate students with technical and job skills. I was a part of the Data Analytical track and we were tasked to run a simulated analytical project where our team were tasked with using an agency company's historical data to organize different strategies based on the inventory, creativity, audience, and location of the agencyâ€™s data. Our task will ensure the company can maximize its future strategy and grow.
